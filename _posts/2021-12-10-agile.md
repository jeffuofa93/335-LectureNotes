## Two Main Goals of 335

- OOP programming and Design
  - Understand all there is to know about oop with Java
  - Learn event driven programming, UML and how to use existing frameworks
- Introduce Software Engineering
  - Develop a large software system in a team of four

## Waterfall Model

- Waterfall was described by 1970
- Understaood as
  - finish each phase
  - don't proceed until done
- W.W Royce critized this approach, proposed an iterative approach

## Waterfall Became Popular

- Managers really like this method because it's easy to set deadlines
- Issues
  - Change is hard
  - Developers are not involved in design or testing

## Waterfall or Not

- Doesn't really work 87% of projects ended of failing when being shown to the clients

## A Spiral Approach

## Agile Software Development

- Set of practices to produce good software
- Promotes customer involvement and promotes team work
- Agile is a philosophy

## Agile Principles

- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months with preference to the shorter
  timescale
- Working software is the primary measure of progress
- Simplicity - art of maximizing the amount of work not done is essential
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior
  accordingly
- Unlike Waterfall we can quickly pivot if theirs structural design issues we need to move away from

## 3 Benefits of Agile

- Ability to manage changing priorities and produce features quickly
- Increased team productivity
- Improved project visibility

## Scrum: One Popular Agile Process

- break work into small sections called Sprints which are usually around 2 weeks
- After each sprint we should have a working increment of the software
- Things to do = Backlog
  - Advantages of backlog in Scrum/Agile vs Waterfall is we can add new things to the backlog as we increment the
    product
- Each sprint we choose some subset of the products backlog to do for the current sprint. Should be most important
  subset
  - take the subtasks for the current sprint and divide it out to the team so each team member has 2 weeks of work
- In the sprint each day we check in with each team member to see their progress on the work completed

## Scrum Roles

- Stakeholder
  - Anyone with an interest in the project
    - end users
    - project sponsors
    - other people you need to interface with in order to complete the project
- Product Owner/Product Manager
  - Person who holds the vision for the product and is responsible for maintaining, prioritizing and updating the
    product backlog
- Scrum Master
  - Help protect the team from distractions and clear impediments
  - Could be product owner or member of dev team
- Dev Team
  - Does the work of creating the product

## Sprints

- **Sprint - a short iteration of developing features and fixing bugs, usually around two-weeks in length**
  - **Sprint Planning** - a meeting between the team and the product owner to plan the sprint
  - **Sprint Review** - a meeting of everyone invloved to see where the project is and how to adapt as needed.
    Sprint review focuses on what was built in the sprint
  - **Sprint Retrospective** - A meeting of the dev team to inspect their last sprint, concentrating on how it was
    done
![img_6.png](/assets/agile/img_6.png?style=centerme)
- Sprint planning is converting the product backlog into a sub section for the sprint backlog and divide up evenly
  between team members

## Daily Standup

- Three questions, what did you do yesterday, what are you working on today and are their anything blocking you
- The point of "stand up" originally was that everyone would stand so that they would be incentivized to make the
  meeting short

## Agile Practice: Sprint Planning

- Planning involves **user stories**
  - short desccriptions of desired features
  - provide value to customer
  - Testable
- PMs or devs themselves write requirments/spec and prioritize
  - What is most important to do?
- Break up these requirments into tasks
- Team members assign/assigned tasks
- Sprint planning is usally done with JIRA but we use a trello board

## Agile Value: Communication

- **Daily Standup - 15 min, what did i do yesterday, what am i doing today, any blockers for my tasks**

## Agile Value: Feedback

- Small sprints
- Constant code review on things like pull requests/merge request in Gitlab
- **Continous Intergration**
  - Dev ops tool to add often to the build and sync your code with a running system
  - Pull the project from GitHub, run all tests including your new tests and code, if all pass, commit locally and
    push automated unit tests
- Comlier feedback - seconds
- Unit test feedback - few minutes
- Acceptance testing: Each iteration
  - Your Scrum Master accepts Sprint 1 or determines what your missing

## Agile Practice: Testing

- Write tests with each piece of added code
- Can use TDD- Test Driven Development where we write tests first
- Allows regression testing
  - Did my changes break things?
![img_10.png](/assets/agile/img_10.png?style=centerme)

## Can't Always Unit Test

- Things we don't have unit tests for
  - GUI's, Network, Views, Randomness
![img_11.png](/assets/agile/img_11.png?style=centerme)

## Agile Practice: On-site customer

- As opposed to waterfall the customer is involved as the stakeholder at each step in the dev process
- Instead of only getting feedback when we complete the entire project we get feedback at the end of every sprint
![img_12.png](/assets/agile/img_12.png?style=centerme)

## Agile Practice: Refactoring

- Restructure code without changing the functionality
- Goal: Keep design simple
  - Change bad design when you find it
  - Remove dead code
- Example: changing the numnber of parameters to a function, or all the way to completely redesigning the architecture
![img_13.png](/assets/agile/img_13.png?style=centerme)

## Technical debt

- bad design decisions or implementations that work but are sub optimal
- It's debt because if you leave it as is it will continue to get worse

## Agile Practice: Pair programming

- Write production code with 2 people on one machine
  - Person 1 - implements the method
  - Person 2 - Thinks strategically about potential improvements, test cases, issues aka observer vs navigator
- Pair change all the time with advantages
  - No single expert on any part of the system
  - Continous code reviews
  - Cheaper in the long run
  - More fun
- Issues with Pair Programming
  - Not all people like it, not everyone gets along
  - Find common time to work together
  - Requires tolerance, acceptance
- Not very popular

## Agile Practice: Collective Ownership

- **NO SILOS**
  - All code can be changed by anybody on the team
- Prevents UI expert and Networking expert makes harder for other members to contribute and creates friction when
  expert is critized

## Coding Standards

- Coding Standard
  - Naming conventions
  - Lest amount of work possible - code should exist once and only once
  - In our project everyone uses Java 16

## Agile Practice: Continous Integration

- Find problems early
- Can see if change breaks system more quickly
- Add to the build in small increments
