- Java orginally had applets in web browsers

## Swing

- AWT replacement
- Intended for desktop applications
- Swing styling is not dependant on the OS
- Swing button is a button due to duck typing it's really a rectangle but it acts like and looks like a button

## JavaFX

- Kind of like HTML + CSS + Java
- JavaFx is intended to be a UI framework for Java
- Lets us write Rich Internet Applications
  - The run under a brows

## Graphical Components in JavaFx

- Stage:
  - Window with title, border, menu, buttons
- Button:
  - A component that can be clicked
- Label:
  - A display area for a small amount of text
  - Static text
- TextField
  - Allows editiing of a single line of text
- BorderPane
  - where we can add buttons, labels ect.. inside the Scene
    ![img_1.png](/assets/javafx/img_1.png?style=centerme)
- We only have on stage and each stage on has one Pane

## Border pane

- Has five positions where we can add children: top, left, center, right and buttom
  ![img_2.png](/assets/javafx/img_2.png?style=centerme)
- top and bottom has a width of 100% width of the window
- left, center and right always stretch from the top to the bottom
- the center expands to space not taken, center content is centered
- Panes can have panes inside of them

## Composite Pattern

- Panes act the same as a single control, pane is a container, also a pane acts as a control
- Similiar to file and directory
- Or student and TA
- I can be something while also holding on to a collection of similiar things

## Event-Driven Programming

![img_4.png](/assets/javafx/img_4.png?style=centerme)
![img_5.png](/assets/javafx/img_5.png?style=centerme)

- if the event functions don't execute fast enough then the operating system will say program is unresponsive
- the handler code needs to be relatively fast, specifically the time it takes
- We can tolerate a second or two
- Make sure to not block the event handling loop
  ![img_7.png](/assets/javafx/img_7.png?style=centerme)
  ![img_9.png](/assets/javafx/img_9.png?style=centerme)
  ![img_10.png](/assets/javafx/img_10.png?style=centerme)
- Callbacks are event driven programming that says when this event happens go here an execute this code
  ![img_11.png](/assets/javafx/img_11.png?style=centerme)
- If you need acess to elements inside lambdas then you need to make the view elements part of the class
  ![img_12.png](/assets/javafx/img_12.png?style=centerme)
- fields should be final which means we can't reassign them but we can update internal fields

## Observer Design Pattern

![img_13.png](/assets/javafx/img_13.png?style=centerme)
![img_14.png](/assets/javafx/img_14.png?style=centerme)
![img_15.png](/assets/javafx/img_15.png?style=centerme)

- Model is observable, view is observer
- You get the entire model in the view in the update method
- The job of the view is to visulaize the model
- With the update message we want to pass the delta or change from the current view to the new update model

## Controller

![img_16.png](/assets/javafx/img_16.png?style=centerme)

- Controller implements the verbs of the program
- Controllers work happens when the user interacts with the view
- Event handlers are controllers
- lambdas are meant to be short
- Our MVC view should only call into the controller for events

## Canvas Node

![img_17.png](/assets/javafx/img_17.png?style=centerme)

- graphics draw line, circles, text, color
  ![img_18.png](/assets/javafx/img_18.png?style=centerme)
  ![img_19.png](/assets/javafx/img_19.png?style=centerme)
- Coordinate system y++ goes down
  ![img_20.png](/assets/javafx/img_20.png?style=centerme)
- bounding box is the dimensions of the object
- allows us to draw any shape we want on the given area

## Images

- To use images in javafx we first need to load the image into an Image object
  ![img_21.png](/assets/javafx/img_21.png?style=centerme)
- file protocl = "file:images/TheHunter.png"
- relative path
- backgroundLoading true means make the load request non blocking
- Draw Image
